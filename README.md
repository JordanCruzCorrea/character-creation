## Usage

Begin by selecting your avatar display options from the drop downs. Please note that certain options are restrictive; for example, if you select Eyepatch for top, accessories won't be available. If you select Hijab for top, facial hair will be unavailable.

This comes from the avatar library side, certain options are incompatible with others. Other than a small number of those restrictions, please customize as much as you'd like! After you finish your avatar, enter your information and click submit. You will be redirected to the Browse page which will display all the current characters.

## Roadmap

- Update and delete
- Search and sort
- Page color theme by House selection
- Add conditional display to Create Avatar form (if no facial hair is displayed, don't display facial hair color)
